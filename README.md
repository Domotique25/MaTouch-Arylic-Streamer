# MaTouch-Arylic-Streamer

Arylic streamer driven by a MaTouch rotating display

This mock-up project uses a MaTouch ESP32-S3 rotating touchscreen to drive an Arylic Up2Stream Pro streamer with its basic controls and via a serial link:
- Volume
- Source Selection and Presets
- Tones
- On/Off

The other features of the streamer can be accessed via wifi with the "STREAM" app  

An interface card allows to manage the power on or off of the streamer and future amps via the I2C bus integrated into the MaTouch terminal and adapds the differents levels (3.3V / 5V).
The Arylic streamer is equipped with a DAC for better audio signal quality.
